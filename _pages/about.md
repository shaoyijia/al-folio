I am a senior undergraduate majoring in Data Science (Statistics + Computer Science) at Yuanpei College in [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to work as a research assistant in [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/english/home/index.htm) under the guidance of Prof. [Bing Liu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/). In 2022 summer, I joined Plus Lab in [UCLA](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) as a research intern instructed by Prof. [Nanyun (Violet) Peng](https://vnpeng.net/). Passionate about deploying machine learning systems in the real world, I focus on research in Open-world Machine Learning, Continual Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

Previously, I also had two fantastic experience in the industry. I have worked as a research intern with Dr. [Mengyu Zhou](http://zmy.io/) in Microsoft Research Asia and an engineering intern with [Tensorflow Lite team](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) in Google, Beijing.
