I am a senior undergraduate in [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), majoring in Data Science (Statistics + Computer Science). I am fortunate to work as a research assistant in [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/english/home/index.htm), instructed by Prof. [Bing Liu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/). I also work as a research intern instructed by Prof. [Nanyun (Violet) Peng](https://vnpeng.net/) at Plus Lab in [UCLA](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) in 2022 summer. I am passionate about deploying machine learning systems in the real world. With this interest, I am doing research in Open-world Machine Learning, Continual Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

Previously, I also had two fantastic experience in the industry, working as a research intern with Dr. [Mengyu Zhou](http://zmy.io/) in Microsoft Research Asia and an engineer intern with [Tensorflow Lite team](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) in Google, Beijing.
