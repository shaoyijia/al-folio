I am a senior undergraduate majoring in Data Science (Statistics + Computer Science) at Yuanpei College in [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to work as a research assistant in [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/english/home/index.htm) under the guidance of Prof. [Bing Liu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/). In 2022 summer, I joined Plus Lab in [UCLA](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) as a research intern instructed by Prof. [Nanyun (Violet) Peng](https://vnpeng.net/). Passionate about deploying machine learning systems in the real world, I focus on research in Open-world Machine Learning, Continual Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

Previously, I also had two fantastic experience in the industry. I have worked as a research intern with Dr. [Mengyu Zhou](http://zmy.io/) in Microsoft Research Asia ([blog spotlight in Chinese](https://www.msra.cn/zh-cn/news/outreach-articles/%e5%ae%9e%e4%b9%a0%e6%b4%be%ef%bd%9c%e9%82%b5%e5%a5%95%e4%bd%b3%ef%bc%9a%e6%8a%80%e8%83%bd%e7%82%b9%e6%bb%a1%e7%9a%84%e5%85%ad%e8%be%b9%e5%bd%a2%e6%88%98%e5%a3%ab%e5%8d%87%e7%ba%a7)) and an engineering intern with [Tensorflow Lite team](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) in Google, Beijing.
