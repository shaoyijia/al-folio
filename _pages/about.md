I am a 1st-year PhD student at [Stanford NLP](https://nlp.stanford.edu/). Previously, I was an undergraduate student at [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/aboutyuanpei/collegeprofile/index.htm) in Peking University where I got into ML and NLP research by working with [Bing Liu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/). In summer 2022 , I had a research internship in UCLA hosted by [Nanyun Peng](https://vnpeng.net/). Before that, I have worked as a research intern with [Mengyu Zhou](http://zmy.io/) in Microsoft Research Asia ([blog spotlight in Chinese](https://www.msra.cn/zh-cn/news/outreach-articles/%e5%ae%9e%e4%b9%a0%e6%b4%be%ef%bd%9c%e9%82%b5%e5%a5%95%e4%bd%b3%ef%bc%9a%e6%8a%80%e8%83%bd%e7%82%b9%e6%bb%a1%e7%9a%84%e5%85%ad%e8%be%b9%e5%bd%a2%e6%88%98%e5%a3%ab%e5%8d%87%e7%ba%a7)) and an engineering intern with [Tensorflow Lite team](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) in Google, Beijing.

My research interests lie in ML and NLP. Nowadays, I'm interested in positioning NLP models (e.g., LLM) into larger systems. Here are some core problems I'm thinking about:
- How can NLP models bridge human and systems or systems and systems?
- How to build socially aware models to ensure safe, comfortable and supportive interaction with users?
- How to continually improve the models through the interaction with human and external systems?

Many kind people helped me a lot in my journey. If you want to talk more about research or seek advice that I may be able to provide, feel free to email me or book a chat [here](https://calendly.com/shaoyj/20min).
